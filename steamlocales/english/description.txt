[h2]Production[/h2]
This software works by performing actions on input clips at random with little user input. Through the power of effect chances and asset libraries, hypothetical dice are rolled for a dose of unpredictability. With each clip, the software determines whether or not to use an effect, which effect to choose, and even selecting a green screen overlay. Chance will guide your comedic journey with the magic of Nonsensical Video Generator!
[h2]Workshop[/h2]
Create your own custom effects and upload them for anyone to use! Effects are scripted in Lua and documentation is provided to get started. You can use built-in templates and upload to the Steam Workshop directly in-app.
